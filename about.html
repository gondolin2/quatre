        <h3>About Gondolin</h3>
        <p>
            Gondolin was a historic elven city located in the heart of Beleriand in Arda.
            The city was founded in FA (First Age) 116 by the Noldorin king 
            Turgon the Wise. It has been known as the City of Seven names, including
            Gondothlimbar, Gar Thurion, Gwarestrin, Gondobar, and Ondolinde. It was the dwelling place
            of Turgon and his people for most of the First Age.</p>
        <p>
            Gondolin was described as this - "Now the streets of Gondolin were paved with stone and wide, 
            kerbed with marble, and fair houses and courts amid gardens of bright flowers were set 
            about the ways, and many towers of great slenderness and beauty builded of white marble 
            and carved most marvelously rose to the heaven. Squares there were lit with fountains 
            and the home of birds that sang amid the branches of their aged trees, but of all these 
            the greatest was that place where stood the King's palace, and the tower thereof was the 
            loftiest in the city, and the fountains that played before the doors shot twenty fathoms 
            and seven in the air and fell in a singing rain of crystal; therein did the sun glitter 
            splendidly by day, and the moon most magically shimmered by night. The birds that dwelt there 
            were of the whiteness of snow and their voices sweeter than a lullaby of music."
