        <h3>The People of Gondolin</h3>
        <p>
            The people of Gondolin were known as the Gondolindrim. They
            were comprised of the Noldorin and Sindarin Elves and
            spoke the Elven languages of Sindarin and Quenya. The Gondolindrim
            were keen in the arts, constructions, and were valiant fighters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not much more is known about the Gondolindrim, as they lived under
            the ultimate law of secrecy. They observed a celebration known
            as the Gates of Summer. This is still celebrated today amongst visitors
            of the ruins of the city. See the Visit page to learn more.
        </p>
        <h4>Turgon the Wise: Year of the Trees 1300 - First Age 510</h4>
        <p>
            The Noldorin Elf of Gondolin. He was the King of Gondolin
            and the High King of the Noldor. Turgon was feared by Morgoth but
            was eventually betrayed and fell to the Dark Lord.
        </p>
        <h4>Aredhel: Year of the Trees 1362 - FA 400</h4>
        <p>
            The Princess of Gondolin; also known as the "White Lady of the Noldor".
             She was the sister of Turgon and the mother of Maeglin.
        </p>
        <h4>Maeglin: FA 320 - FA 510</h4>
        <p>The son of Aredel and nephew of Turgon. The betrayer of Gondolin, he was captured by the orcs of Morgoth
            and exchanged his life for the location of the great hidden city.
