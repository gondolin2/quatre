            "Rejoice that ye have found it and rest from endless war
            for the seven-naméd city 'tis that stands upon the hill,
            where all who strive with Morgoth find hope and valour still."</blockquote>

        <p>
            The round valley of Tumladen surrounded by the Encircling Mountains
            had originally been a lake. In its center stood a hill that was once an island:
            Amon Gwareth. The only way to enter the valley was through the secret
            path of Orfalch Echor. Thus Gondolin became the hidden city of the Elves.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here in FA 50, Turgon decided to found a great city to be hidden from the Dark Lord Morgoth.
            For nearly seventy-five years, Turgon and his people built Gondolin in secret.
            It was completed in FA 116 and housed nearly a third of the Noldor and three
            quarters of the northern Sindar.
        </p>
        <blockquote>"Thus it was in Gondolin; and amid all the bliss of that realm, 
            while its glory lasted, a dark seed of evil was sown"</blockquote>
        <p>
            Gondolin lasted for nearly four-hundred years. The Ainu known as Ulmo warned
            Turgon to depart the city before it was destroyed. The warnings were ignored.
            Turgon's nephew Maeglin betrayed Gondolin and its people in service of
            Morgoth. The city was eventually destroyed. The ruins can be seen today
            and are often visited by tourists coming to Middle Earth and Beleriand.
